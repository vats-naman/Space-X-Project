# Space-X-Project
In this project, I take the role of a data scientist working for a new rocket company 'Space Y' that would like to compete with SpaceX. My job is to determine the price of each launch. I have to do this by gathering information about Space X and creating dashboards for my team. I also determine if SpaceX will reuse the first stage. Instead of using rocket science to determine if the first stage will land successfully, I will train a machine learning classification model and use public information to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.
The Following Steps were followed:
1) Data Collection through SpaceX API and Webscapping Wikipedia Pages
2) Data Wrangling
3) Exploratory Data Analysis using SQL
4) Exploratory Data Analysis via Data Visualization using Matplotlib,Plotly & Seaborn.
5) Buildind a map using Folium and showing all the Launch SItes
6) Interactive SpaceX Dashboard using Plotly & Dash
7) Building A Machine Learning Classification Model to predict if the first stage lands successfully
8) Creating a Presentation with the summary of all steps.
